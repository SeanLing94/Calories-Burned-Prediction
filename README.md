# Calories-Burned-Prediction
This assignment encompassed the implementation of exploratory and predictive modeling techniques using data mining tools. Key highlights of the assignment include:

Data Understanding and Preparation: 
A thorough understanding of the dataset, which focused on predicting calorie expenditure, was achieved. Data preprocessing involved handling missing values, converting categorical features to numerical representations, and splitting the data into training and test sets to avoid data leakage.

Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA): 
EDA was carried out to gain insights into the dataset's characteristics. Visualizations, correlation analysis, and statistical summaries provided valuable information about the relationships and patterns within the data.

Model Selection: 
Two regression models, Linear Regression and Random Forest Regressor, were chosen for predictive modeling. Linear Regression was selected for its simplicity and interpretability, while Random Forest Regressor was chosen for its ability to capture complex relationships in the data.

Hyperparameter Tuning: 
Hyperparameter tuning was performed using GridSearchCV to optimize the Random Forest Regressor model. This process systematically searched a hyperparameter space to enhance model performance.

Model Evaluation: 
Model performance was assessed using common regression metrics, including Mean Absolute Error (MAE), Mean Squared Error (MSE), and Root Mean Squared Error (RMSE). The Random Forest Regressor consistently outperformed the Linear Regression model across all evaluation metrics, indicating its superiority in making more accurate predictions.

Conclusion: In this assignment, the Random Forest Regressor emerged as the best model for predicting calorie expenditure, providing lower MAE, MSE, and RMSE compared to Linear Regression. This result underscores the importance of selecting the right model for the specific task and leveraging the capabilities of advanced algorithms like Random Forest to capture intricate relationships within the data.
In summary, the assignment showcased the application of data mining techniques for exploratory analysis and predictive modeling, highlighting the significance of model selection and evaluation in solving real-world problems.
